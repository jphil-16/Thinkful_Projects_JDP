thought process:,
"1) scatter plot the data, look for immediate visual patterns, and plot relationships between the columns",
,Answer: it's a map!
"2) North America seems to be the most dense and well-defined, along with Europe - why is that?",
,"Note: In general, it seems like the data points are related to population, or at least ""developed"" population"
,"Note: Some repeated data points, particularly at the front end of the dataset"
3) Could it be a map of the largest cities in the world? That doesn't make sense with the data repeats though…I should check where the repeats are located,
,Note: There is one data point in SE Asia repeated 100 times in the first 129 entries
,"Note: Other than that, no obvious pattern…"
